2. Replace the existing rules with the content from `firebase.rules`
3. Click "Publish" to deploy the new rules

### 2. Test User Accounts
Create test accounts with different roles:

2. **Data Access:**

   - ✅ Users can only read their own notifications
   - ✅ Admins can read all notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Remove as Admin" button not visible**
   - Check if logged in as main admin (karehallbooking@gmail.com)
   - Verify user is actually an admin

2. **Promotion not working**
   - Check Firestore rules are deployed
   - Verify user has admin role
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Redirect not working**
   - Check AuthContext is properly updated
   - Verify user role in Firestore
   - Check browser console for errors

4. **UI not responsive**

   - Test on different devices

### Debug Steps

1. **Check User Role:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   console.log('Current user:', currentUser);
   console.log('User role:', currentUser?.role);
   ```

2. **Check Firestore Data:**
   ```javascript
   // In Firebase Console
   // Go to Firestore → users → [user-id]
   // Verify role field is correct
   ```

   - Look for failed requests to Firestore
   - Check error messages in console
