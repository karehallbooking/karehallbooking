# Event Booking Students (Placeholder)

This directory is reserved for the future **student-facing** experience of the Event Booking platform.

Requirements for this folder (when implemented):

- Public booking screens for students.
- Registration forms with QR download.
- Student dashboards to view bookings and certificates.

No student pages are required at the moment, so this folder simply documents its purpose. All current functionality lives inside `eventbookingadmin/`.
# Event Booking - Student Pages

This folder is reserved for student-facing pages of the Event Booking system.

**Status:** Placeholder - Student pages are not required at this time.

---

## Future Implementation

When student pages are implemented, this folder will contain:
- Student registration interface
- Student dashboard
- QR code display for students
- Certificate download interface
- Other student-facing features
